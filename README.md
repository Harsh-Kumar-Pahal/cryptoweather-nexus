# CryptoWeather Nexus

CryptoWeather Nexus is a web application that provides real-time weather updates, cryptocurrency prices, and news articles for selected cities and cryptocurrencies. The app features a dashboard with weather, crypto, and news sections, detailed pages for cities and cryptocurrencies, a favorites feature, and toast notifications for price changes and weather alerts.

## Features

- **Dashboard:** Displays weather for New York, London, and Tokyo; crypto prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin; and recent news articles.
- **Detail Pages:** View detailed weather information for a city (`/city/[city]`) and detailed crypto information for a cryptocurrency (`/crypto/[crypto]`).
- **Favorites:** Add or remove cities and cryptocurrencies to/from a favorites list, stored in Redux state.
- **Notifications:** Real-time toast notifications for significant crypto price changes (via WebSocket) and simulated weather alerts (every 30 seconds).
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git:** Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **API Keys:**
  - **OpenWeatherMap API Key:** Sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get an API key for weather data.
  - **NewsData.io API Key:** Sign up at [newsdata.io](https://newsdata.io/) to get an API key for news articles.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptoweather-nexus.git
   cd cryptoweather-nexus
Install Dependencies:
bash
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env.local file in the root of the project.
Add the following environment variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWSDATA_API_KEY=your_newsdata_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINCAP_WS=wss://ws.coincap.io/prices?assets=bitcoin,ethereum,binance-coin
Replace your_openweathermap_key and your_newsdata_key with your actual API keys.
Run the Development Server:
bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.
Usage
Dashboard:
The homepage (/) displays three sections: Weather, Crypto, and News.
Weather data is shown for New York, London, and Tokyo.
Crypto prices are shown for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin.
News articles are fetched based on a general query.
Detail Pages:
Click on a city name (e.g., "New York") to visit /city/new-york for detailed weather information.
Click on a cryptocurrency name (e.g., "Bitcoin") to visit /crypto/bitcoin for detailed crypto information.
Favorites:
On the dashboard or detail pages, click the "Favorite" button to add a city or cryptocurrency to your favorites.
Favorites are stored in Redux state and persist during the session.
Notifications:
Toast notifications appear when a cryptocurrency price changes by more than $100 (via WebSocket).
A simulated weather alert ("Storm warning in Tokyo!") appears every 30 seconds.
Design Decisions
Tech Stack
Next.js: Chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities, which improve SEO and performance. The App Router was used for routing.
React: Used for building the UI components, leveraging its component-based architecture.
TypeScript: Added for type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.
Redux Toolkit: Used for state management, particularly for weather, crypto, news, and favorites data. Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup with features like createSlice and createAsyncThunk.
Tailwind CSS: Used for styling, providing a utility-first approach for rapid and responsive design.
React-Toastify: Used for toast notifications, offering a simple and customizable way to display alerts.
WebSocket (CoinCap API): Used for real-time crypto price updates, ensuring users receive immediate notifications of price changes.
Architecture
File Structure:
src/app/: Contains the Next.js App Router pages (page.tsx for the dashboard, [city]/page.tsx for city details, [crypto]/page.tsx for crypto details).
src/components/: Contains reusable components like WeatherSection, CryptoSection, NewsSection, and NotificationToast.
src/redux/: Contains Redux slices (weatherSlice, cryptoSlice, newsSlice, favoritesSlice) and the store configuration.
src/lib/: Contains utility functions, such as websocket.ts for WebSocket setup.
State Management:
Redux Toolkit was used to manage global state for weather, crypto, news, and favorites.
createAsyncThunk was used to handle asynchronous API calls in a standardized way.
Routing:
Dynamic routes (/city/[city] and /crypto/[crypto]) were used to create detail pages for cities and cryptocurrencies.
Notifications:
A WebSocket connection to CoinCap API was implemented in NotificationToast.tsx to receive real-time crypto price updates.
A simulated weather alert was added using setInterval to demonstrate weather notifications.
Styling
Tailwind CSS was used for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid styling directly in the JSX/TSX files.
The app is fully responsive, with Tailwindâ€™s responsive classes (e.g., md:grid-cols-3) ensuring the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
Challenges Faced
Environment Variables in Vercel:
Challenge: The app initially crashed on deployment due to missing environment variables, causing API calls and WebSocket connections to fail.
Solution: Added the required environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWSDATA_API_KEY, etc.) in the Vercel dashboard and redeployed the app.
TypeScript Errors:
Challenge: TypeScript errors occurred when parsing WebSocket data and using the react-toastify library, such as Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive.
Solution: Removed unnecessary @ts-expect-error comments after ensuring proper typing of WebSocket data and toast options.
React Hooks Warnings:
Challenge: The react-hooks/exhaustive-deps warning appeared in page.tsx and NotificationToast.tsx due to missing dependencies in useEffect hooks.
Solution: Moved the cities array outside the component in page.tsx to prevent re-renders. In NotificationToast.tsx, replaced useState with useRef for lastPrice to avoid dependency issues.
API Rate Limits:
Challenge: During development, API rate limits for OpenWeatherMap and NewsData.io caused requests to fail intermittently.
Solution: Implemented error handling in Redux slices to display error messages gracefully and used a 2-minute interval for refreshing data to reduce API calls.
First-Time Deployment:
Challenge: As a first-time user of Vercel, navigating the deployment prompts and understanding the difference between preview and production URLs was confusing.
Solution: Followed the Vercel CLI prompts carefully, deployed a preview URL first to test the app, and then deployed to production using vercel --prod.
Future Improvements
User Authentication: Add user authentication to persist favorites across sessions using a backend database.
More Cities and Cryptos: Allow users to add custom cities and cryptocurrencies to the dashboard.
Improved Notifications: Integrate real weather alerts from an API instead of simulating them.
Testing: Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code reliability.
This project was developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate skills in Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, and deployment with Vercel.
